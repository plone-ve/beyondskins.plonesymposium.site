Select and enable the theme from the Diazo control panel. That's it!


Buildout
^^^^^^^^

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

1. Edit your ``buildout.cfg`` and add ``beyondskins.plonesymposium.site`` to the list of eggs to
   install ::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        beyondskins.plonesymposium.site

After updating the configuration you need to run ``bin/buildout``, which will
take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ''beyondskins.plonesymposium.site'' and click the 'Activate' button.

Uninstall -- This can be done from the same management screen, but only
if you installed it from the quick installer.

Note: You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
in order to see the effects of the product installation.

Or, you can add it as a dependency on your own product ``setup.py`` file: ::

    install_requires=[
        ...
        'beyondskins.plonesymposium.site',
    ],
